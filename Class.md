<h1 align="center">JavaScript Class</h1>
A JavaScript  is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data and functions that manipulate data. A class declaration is syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance with additional enhancements.

##### <b><i>Note:<i/></b> `Classes were introduced in EcmaScript 2015 (ES6) to provide a cleaner way to follow object-oriented programming patterns.`
