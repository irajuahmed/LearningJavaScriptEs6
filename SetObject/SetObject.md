In JavaScript `Set` is a collection of unique values. `Set` can hold any value of any data type & the elements in `sets` are iterated in their insertion order. `Set` is the collection of values similar to arrays, but it does not contain any duplicates.

## Characteristics:

- It can hold any data type.
- It shows data as it insertion order.
- `Set` does not have index.
- A `Set` has no keys.
